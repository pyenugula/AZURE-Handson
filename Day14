CLI Solution
You can create a managed disk using the following Azure CLI command:
az disk create \
  --resource-group <your-resource-group> \
  --name xfusion-disk \
  --size-gb 2 \
  --sku Standard_LRS
Explanation:
--resource-group: Replace <your-resource-group> with the name of the resource group where you want to create the managed disk.
--name: Specifies the name of the disk, which is xfusion-disk.
--size-gb: Specifies the size of the disk as 2 GiB.
--sku: Sets the disk type to Standard_LRS (Locally Redundant Storage).
This command will create a 2 GiB managed disk with the specified properties.

Console (Azure Portal) Solution
Go to the Azure Portal: Open the Azure Portal.
Navigate to Disks:
In the left-hand navigation pane, search for "Disks" and click on it.
Click on "+ + Add" to create a new disk.
Configure the Disk:
Subscription: Choose the appropriate subscription.
Resource Group: Select the resource group where you want to create the managed disk.
Disk Name: Enter xfusion-disk as the disk name.
Region: Select the region where your resources are located (ensure the region is the same as the resource group).
Disk Type: Select Standard_LRS.
Size: Set the size to 2 GiB (2 GB).
Review and Create:
After configuring the disk settings, click Review + Create.
Once validation passes, click Create to provision the managed disk.
Verification
To verify that the managed disk was created successfully, you can use the following CLI command:
az disk show \

  --name xfusion-disk
This will show the details of the xfusion-disk disk, including its size and type.
