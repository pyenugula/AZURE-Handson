with creating an Azure Virtual Machine (VM).

The requirements are:

1) Use the existing resource group.
2) The VM name must be datacenter-vm, it should be in centralus region.
3) Use the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS image for the VM.
4) The VM size must be Standard_B1s.
5) Attach a default Network Security Group (NSG) that allows inbound SSH (port 22).
6) Attach a 30 GB storage disk of type Standard HDD.
7) The rest of the configurations should remain as default.

After completing these steps, make sure you can SSH into the virtual machine.

CLI Solution
Here is the Azure CLI command to create the VM as per your specifications:
az vm create \
  --resource-group <your-resource-group> \
  --name datacenter-vm \
  --image UbuntuLTS \
  --size Standard_B1s \
  --location centralus \
  --admin-username <your-username> \
  --generate-ssh-keys \
  --nsg-rule SSH \
  --storage-sku Standard_HDD \
  --data-disk-sizes-gb 30


Console Solution (Azure Portal)

Go to the Azure Portal: Open Azure Portal.
Create the Virtual Machine:
In the left-hand navigation pane, search for "Virtual machines" and click on it.
Click "+ Add" to create a new VM.
Configure the VM:
Subscription: Choose the appropriate subscription.
Resource Group: Select the existing resource group where you want to create the VM.
VM Name: Enter datacenter-vm as the name of your VM.
Region: Set the region to Central US (centralus).
Image: Under Image, select Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
Size: Select Standard_B1s from the VM sizes available.
Authentication Type: Choose SSH public key and provide the SSH public key or use the Generate SSH key pair option.
Networking:
Ensure that a Network Security Group (NSG) is attached to allow inbound SSH (port 22).
You can create a new Network Security Group if needed, or choose an existing one.
Disks:
Under the Disks tab, ensure the OS Disk is set to Standard HDD type.
In the Data Disks section, click on + Add data disk.
Set the Size to 30 GB and choose Standard HDD for disk type.
Review + Create:
Click Review + Create to review your settings.
After validation passes, click Create to deploy the VM.
SSH into the VM
Once the VM is deployed, you can SSH into the machine using the public IP address. To get the public IP:
In the Azure Portal, go to your VM.
Under the Overview tab, copy the Public IP address.
Then, use the following SSH command to connect to the VM:
ssh <your-username>@<public-ip-address>
Replace <your-username> with the username you set during the VM creation, and <public-ip-address> with the actual IP you copied.
