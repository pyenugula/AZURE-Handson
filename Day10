An existing VM named datacenter-vm-pip and a public IP address named datacenter-pip already exist.

Attach the public IP datacenter-pip to the network interface of the VM datacenter-vm-pip.
Make sure the VM is properly assigned the public IP.

Console (Azure Portal) Solution
Go to the Virtual Machine:
In the Azure Portal, navigate to Virtual Machines.
Select the VM datacenter-vm-pip.
Go to the Networking Section:
Under the Settings section, click on Networking.
You’ll see the list of network interfaces under Network interface.
Edit the Network Interface:
Click on the Network Interface associated with the VM (this will bring you to the NIC’s settings page).
In the IP configurations section, click on ipconfig1 (or the correct configuration).
Associate the Public IP:
In the Public IP address section, select datacenter-pip from the dropdown menu.
If it’s not selected, click Associate and choose the existing public IP datacenter-pip from the list.
Save the Changes:
After associating the public IP, click Save to apply the changes.

CLI Solution
Identify the Network Interface (NIC) of the VM:
First, we need to identify the network interface attached to the VM datacenter-vm-pip. Use the following command to get the NIC name:
az vm show \
  --resource-group <your-resource-group> \
  --name datacenter-vm-pip \
  --query "networkProfile.networkInterfaces[0].id" \
  --output tsv

Attach the Public IP to the Network Interface:
Now, use the following command to associate the existing public IP (datacenter-pip) with the network interface:
az network nic ip-config update \
  --resource-group <your-resource-group> \
  --nic-name <nic-name> \
  --name ipconfig1 \
  --public-ip-address datacenter-pip
