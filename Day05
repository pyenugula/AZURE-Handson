create a Virtual Network (VNet) named nautilus-vnet and one subnet named nautilus-subnet within the VNet in the westus region. 
Make sure the IPv4 address range is 10.0.0.0/16.

CLI Solution
You can create both the VNet and Subnet using the Azure CLI with the following steps:
Create the Virtual Network:
az network vnet create \
  --resource-group <your-resource-group> \
  --name nautilus-vnet \
  --location westus \
  --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16

Explanation:
--resource-group: Replace <your-resource-group> with the name of your existing resource group.
--name: Sets the name of the VNet to nautilus-vnet.
--location: Specifies the region as westus.
--address-prefix: Defines the CIDR block for the VNet, which is 10.0.0.0/16 in this case.

Create the Subnet within the VNet:
az network vnet subnet create \
  --resource-group <your-resource-group> \
  --vnet-name nautilus-vnet \
  --name nautilus-subnet \
  --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/24

Explanation:
--resource-group: Replace <your-resource-group> with the name of your existing resource group.
--vnet-name: Specifies the name of the Virtual Network as nautilus-vnet.
--name: Specifies the name of the subnet as nautilus-subnet.
--address-prefix: Specifies the CIDR block for the subnet. Here, 10.0.0.0/24 is used, which provides IP addresses from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255. You can adjust this based on your needs.

Console (Azure Portal) Solution
To create the Virtual Network and Subnet in the Azure Portal, follow these steps:
Go to the Azure Portal: Open Azure Portal.
Create the Virtual Network:
In the left-hand navigation pane, search for "Virtual networks" and select it.
Click "+ Create" to create a new Virtual Network.
Configure the Virtual Network:
Subscription: Choose the appropriate subscription.
Resource Group: Select the existing resource group where you want to create the VNet.
Name: Enter the name as nautilus-vnet.
Region: Set the region to West US (westus).
Address Space: Enter 10.0.0.0/16 in the Address space field to define the range of IP addresses.
Create the Subnet:
In the Subnets section, click + Add Subnet to create the subnet.
Subnet Name: Set the name as nautilus-subnet.
Subnet Address Range: Enter 10.0.0.0/24 for the subnet address range.
Review + Create:
Once you've configured both the VNet and the subnet, click Review + Create to review your settings.
After validation passes, click Create to deploy the VNet and subnet.
