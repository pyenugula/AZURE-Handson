1) Change the VM size from Standard_B1s to Standard_B2s for the virtual machine named devops-vm.

2) Ensure the VM is in the running state after the size change is complete.

Console (Azure Portal) Solution
To resize the VM using the Azure Portal, follow these steps:
Go to the Azure Portal: Open Azure Portal.
Navigate to the Virtual Machine:
In the left-hand navigation pane, search for "Virtual machines" and select it.
Click on the devops-vm virtual machine.
Stop the VM:
In the Overview page of the VM, click on the Stop button. Wait until the VM status changes to Stopped (Deallocated).
Resize the VM:
Once the VM is stopped, in the VM's Overview page, click on Size under the Settings section.
Choose Standard_B2s from the available VM sizes and click Select.
Start the VM:
After resizing, go back to the Overview page and click Start to start the VM.
Verify the VM is Running:
Once the VM is started, verify that the VM status is listed as Running under the Overview page.

CLI Solution
Changing the size of a running VM requires the VM to be stopped first, as you cannot resize a VM while it is running. However, the VM will automatically start once the resizing operation is complete.
Here are the steps:
Stop the VM (Required for resizing):
az vm deallocate --resource-group <your-resource-group> --name devops-vm
This command stops the VM and releases the resources, but the VM is not deleted.
Resize the VM to Standard_B2s:

az vm resize --resource-group <your-resource-group> --name devops-vm --size Standard_B2s

Start the VM (After resizing):
Once the resize operation is complete, start the VM using the following command:
az vm start --resource-group <your-resource-group> --name devops-vm

Verify the VM is in the Running State:
Use the following command to check the status of the VM:

az vm show --resource-group <your-resource-group> --name devops-vm --query "powerState"
