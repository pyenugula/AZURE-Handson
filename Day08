Under the Data disks section, click + Add data disk.
Click on Create disk if you want to create a new managed disk.
Provide the Disk name, Region, and Size.

Wait for the Disk to Attach:
After the disk is created or selected, it will automatically be attached to the virtual machine.

You can attach a managed disk to an existing VM using the following Azure CLI commands.
1. Create a Managed Disk (if you don't have an existing one):
To create a new managed disk:
az disk create \
  --resource-group <your-resource-group> \
  --name <your-disk-name> \
  --size-gb <disk-size> \
  --sku Standard_LRS

2. Attach the Managed Disk to a VM:
After creating the managed disk, you can attach it to your virtual machine:
az vm disk attach \
  --resource-group <your-resource-group> \
  --vm-name <your-vm-name> \
  --name <your-disk-name>

Verifying the Disk Attachment
To verify that the disk has been successfully attached, you can use the following CLI command:

az vm show --resource-group <your-resource-group> --name <your-vm-name> --query "storageProfile.dataDisks"
