An existing VM named nautilus-vm and a network interface named nautilus-nic already exist in the centralus region.
Attach the network interface nautilus-nic to the VM nautilus-vm.
Ensure the NIC's status is attached before submitting the task.

CLI Solution
1. Attach the Network Interface to the VM:
Use the following command to attach the network interface to the virtual machine:
az vm nic add \
  --resource-group <your-resource-group> \
  --vm-name nautilus-vm \
  --nic nautilus-nic

Explanation:
--resource-group: Replace <your-resource-group> with the name of the resource group that contains the VM and NIC.
--vm-name: Specifies the name of the virtual machine (nautilus-vm).
--nic: Specifies the name of the network interface (nautilus-nic) that you want to attach to the VM.
This command will attach the specified NIC (nautilus-nic) to the virtual machine (nautilus-vm).

2. Verify the NIC Attachment:
To verify the network interface is attached to the VM, use the following command:
az vm show --resource-group <your-resource-group> --name nautilus-vm --query "networkProfile.networkInterfaces"

Console (Azure Portal) Solution
1. Navigate to the Virtual Machine:
In the Azure Portal, go to the Virtual Machines section.
Find and select the nautilus-vm virtual machine.
2. Go to the Networking Section:
In the VM's Settings section, click on Networking.
3. Add Network Interface:
Under the Network interfaces section, click + Attach network interface.
In the Attach network interface blade:
Select the existing nautilus-nic network interface.
Click Save.
4. Verify the NIC Attachment:
After attaching, go to the Networking section of the nautilus-vm to confirm that nautilus-nic is listed under the Network interfaces section.
